# Soundcraft Spirit Studio Restoration

Tom Dial

## Background

The Soundcraft Spirit Studio recording console was originally released in 1990.
According to my research, two frame sizes were provided: a 16 channel frame
and a 24 channel frame. Targeting the home studio market, the Spirit Studio was
an "inline" console where each channel has dual inputs: mic/line, and tape
return.

The console also features direct outputs on each channel, 8 group buses, 4-band
EQ including two parametric bands (and the EQ's can be split between mic/line
and tape returns as well), and a host of effects sends as well as two
"foldback" monitor mix sends. All in all, the feature list is quite impressive!

A console of this type as likely to be paired with a semi-pro 8-track recorder
such as those available from Tascam. but around the same time, Alesis released
the ADAT, which put digital multitrack recording in the hands of the masses for
the first time. Since ADATs could be linked together with sample-accurate
synchronization, the 16 or 24 track studios came into reach for serious home
musicians and project studios, and along with completely hard-disk / DAW based
systems, were probably the death knell for small or medium professional
studios in some cases (citation needed.)

For years, I've operated without a hardware mixer, opting instead to expand my
I/O capabilities and record synths directly into Pro Tools and Logic. However,
when I became interested in the craft of mixing, I noted that many of the
engineers I admired had "grown up" in the era of analog consoles and had
developed plenty of intuition in terms of gain staging and EQ by using analog
consoles in the past (even when many of them have since moved on.)

So, because I love electronics projects, I decided to buy a reasonably decent
analog mixer cheaply and restore it. Furthermore, I decided to document the
restoration project so that interested parties may learn from my experience
and potentially, avoid my mistakes!

## Before you Start

If you're planning on a console restoration project, I already have a few
suggestions for things that you should consider.

* **Join forums**  These days, there are plenty of online forums for people
  with similar interests. Forums *can* be a good place to learn about the
  pros and cons of various pieces of gear. I say "can" because there are
  also a significant number of people who speak with authority who actually
  have no idea what they are talking about, so be cautious. For me, the key
  value of forums is gaining insight into potential pitfalls, common
  issues, and potentially, sources of spare parts.

* **Shop locally**  Recording consoles like this are can be large and
  heavy. Even the sixteen channel console that I am restoring is large,
  and I ended up paying $100 just in shipping. This was greatly offset by
  the low price that I paid, but I'd encourage you to shop locally where
  possible for two reasons. First, shipping costs. Second, you'll have
  the opportunity to test the console out and see its condition before
  purchasing and incurring shipping costs.

* **Make sure you have schematics** Schematics *can* be hard to find but
  are necessary if you truly need to dig in with the restoration. They are
  also very interesting to read and may give you good ideas if you're
  interested in building projects of your own design.

* **Consider parts availability**  Parts for some consoles can be hard to
  locate. A friend of mine has a Calrec console that uses VCAs that are
  no longer being made. Obtaining spares will be expensive. By contrast,
  the Spirit Studio uses (mostly) still-available op-amps.

* **Ensure the power supply is reliable**  Semi-pro and professional
  consoles will typically have external power supplies. If you're working
  on an older console, you will want to make sure that the power supply is
  in good shape before powering on. While a quality power supply will
  provide adequate protection for faults, it would be bad news if, for
  example, one of the power rails in a bipolar supply failed and the
  other one remained functional. Check large electrolytic capacitors
  (more on that later) and replace if bulging, leaking, etc.

* **Have the correct tools, know how to use them**  Restoration of a
  console will generally require some parts to be repaired or replaced.
  This, in turn, requires desoldering and soldering. You need to have
  the right tools as well the expertise for this. If you don't, you have
  two options: pay a qualified tech, or teach yourself. If you opt for
  the latter, practice using the tools and techniques on old circuit
  boards before touching any gear you care about.

* **Establish a budget**
